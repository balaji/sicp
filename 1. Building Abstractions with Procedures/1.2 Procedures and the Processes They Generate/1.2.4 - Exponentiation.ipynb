(Hint: Using the observation that $(b^{\\frac{n}{2}})^2 = (b^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}}$, keep, along with the exponent $n$ and the base $b$, an additional state variable $a$, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product $ab^n$ is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process $a$ is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of $a$ at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an *invariant quantity* that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)"

    "### Exercise 1.19: \n",
    "There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables $a$ and $b$ in the `fib-iter` process of Section 1.2.2: $a \\leftarrow a+b$ and $b \\leftarrow a$. Call this transformation $T$, and observe that applying $T$ over and over again $n$ times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair $Fib(n + 1)$ and $Fib(n)$. In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying $T^n$ ,the $n^{th}$ power of the transformation $T$, starting with the pair (1, 0). Now consider $T$ to be the special case of $p = 0$ and $q = 1$ in a family of transformations $T_{pq}$, where $T_{pq}$ transforms the pair $(a, b)$ according to $a \\leftarrow bq + aq + ap$ and $b \\leftarrow bp + aq$. Show that if we apply such a transformation $T_{pq}$ twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation $T_{p'q'}$ of the same form, and compute $p'$ and $q'$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute $T^n$ using successive squaring, as in the `fast-expt` procedure. Put this all together to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:\n",
